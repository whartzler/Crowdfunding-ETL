# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview
Working with Britta we extracted CSV files, transformed the data so we can easily upload to PostGres database and loaded the data.  

## Process
Transforming the crowdfunding excel spreadsheet we split out the information into 5 seperate CSV files.  In the Contact info tab in the original crowdfunding CSV the data was all included in one line we had to write code to extract the data and transform it into a useable CSV.  Once all the data was reviewed to make sure we didnt miss anything we created and ERD to easily upload the data into PostGres. Once the data was uplaoded into PostGres we validated the data was uploaded correctly.  Finally we created some additional queries to display the email contacts that have live outcomes the remaining goal amount and the backers their reamining goal amount.

## Conclusion
there was a lot to learn in the ETL process.  The main items learned were getting hands on experience of the ETL process and combining different programs together to get a compelted database.  The tough parts of this project was extracting the data on the contact info's tab as it was all one line even though once the process was practiced it made sense.
